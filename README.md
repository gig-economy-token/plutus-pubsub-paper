# Plutus Publisher-Subscriber whitepaper

On this paper we demonstrate how we can use DataScripts to communicate different programs using the Cardano Blockchain and the Plutus Smart Contract programming language. We construct a mechanism that works in a way akin to a pub-sub communication system.

This mechanism has been developed during the development of the GiG Economy Token.
